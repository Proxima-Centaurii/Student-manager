# Student-manager
An application which keeps track of basic student details and the marks of the modules they take.

The purpose of this project was to choose suitable data structures to store student data and implement them from scratch, and implement searching and sorting algorithms. All of the algorithms and data structures are tested, including any input validators (verifiers) present in the code. For data structures, they were tested agains their Java counter part.
